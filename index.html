        I’m a highschool student in Toronto passionate about STEM and solving world issues. I enjoy participating in hackathons and case study competitions and I aspire to become a full stack developer. I’m a pretty introverted person, but I still enjoy public speaking. I play volleyball and basketball and I also like skating and rock climbing. I love reading in my free time, my favourite book is "Babel" by R.F. Kuang!
